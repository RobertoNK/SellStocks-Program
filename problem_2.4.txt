Book: Java from the beginning

Write a program name SellStocks that calculates the value
of the value of a stock. The user wull be prompted to enter
the stock price, the number of shares to be sold, and the
commission rate. The program will calculate the value of
the shares by multiplying the stock proce by the number of
shares. It will also calculate the commission ( the value
of the shares multiplied by the commission rate) and the
net proceeds (the value of the shares minus the commission).
The following example shows what the user will see on the
screen:
